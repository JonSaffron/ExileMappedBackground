# Exile World Generator
Generates the land of the classic BBC Micro game Exile

For ages, I've wondered how the authors of Exile managed to create such an enormous world for their game and fit it all into 32Kb. I'd read a few explanations, but none of them really did a good job of explaining how they did it. So here it is, my little examination of the ingenuity involved.

For clarity: this is not a game, it simply generates the entire game world using the original data and following the same algorithms. You can therefore explore how everything is put together, from the procedural generation elements, what squares are explicitly mapped data, to what palettes are used.

This wouldn't exist without the fantastic work by @tom-seddon (see https://github.com/tom-seddon/exile_disassembly) which in turn builds on the disassembly by an unknown party at http://www.level7.org.uk/miscellany/exile-disassembly.txt
